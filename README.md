# Tower-defense-project
Repo for a tower defense game I am working on
This is a project focused on creating a ASCII-art tower defense game, where you can place towers that attack enemies that try to reach a destination via a certain path. 
Next steps as of 7th august 2025:
print the path textures on the map, as well as towers and enemies. Hardcoded for now
